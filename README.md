### How do I get set up? ###

In order to make use of Responsive MQ, simply add a reference to the javascript file in your page or using your favourite script loader.
In the attached sample HTML file the references are added manually toward the end of the body tag.

```
#!html
    <script src="jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="responsive-mq.js"></script>
```

### Dependencies ###

Responsive MQ is dependent on jQuery. It's been tested with 1.11 but should be compatible with all versions of jQuery - Feel free to raise a bug if you experience any issues with specifc versions. The reason for this is jQuery's comparatively faster speed when setting up resize event responses.
